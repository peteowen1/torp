# torp 1.0.0 (2026-03-05)

## Breaking Changes

* `load_pbp()` and `load_chains()` now default `rounds = TRUE` (all rounds) instead of the current week. Callers that relied on getting only the latest round without specifying `rounds` will now receive the full season. Use `rounds = get_afl_week()` to restore the old behaviour.

* `load_from_url()` now defaults `use_disk_cache = FALSE` (previously `TRUE`). Pass `use_disk_cache = TRUE` explicitly if you want persistent disk caching.

* `load_fixtures(all = TRUE)` now starts from 2021 (previously 2018). Seasons before 2021 are outside `validate_seasons()` range and were producing errors.

* `check_internet_connection()` has been removed. Use `curl::has_internet()` directly.

* Unexported internal-use functions: `get_wp_model_info()`, `check_wp_model_health()`, `harmonic_mean()`, `norm_name()`. These remain accessible via `torp:::`.

## New Features

* **Local-first data loading**: All `load_*()` functions now check `torpdata/data/` first, then disk cache, then download. Downloaded files are auto-saved locally.

* `download_torp_data()` for bulk-downloading parquet files for offline access.

* **Parallel downloads**: Multi-URL loads use `curl::multi_download()` for faster batch fetching.

* **Negative cache (skip markers)**: 404 URLs are marked with `.skip` files to avoid repeated failed downloads. Use `clear_skip_markers()` to retry.

* **Column selection**: All `load_*()` functions accept a `columns` parameter to read only specific columns.

* New load functions: `load_ep_wp_charts()`, `load_player_game_ratings()`, `load_player_season_ratings()`, `load_team_ratings()`.

* `CREDIT_POS_ADJ_QUANTILE` split into 4 per-dimension constants: `CREDIT_POS_ADJ_QUANTILE_RECV`, `_DISP`, `_SPOIL`, `_HITOUT`.

* Added `R/constants.R` with centralized AFL and model constants:
  - `AFL_GOAL_WIDTH`, `AFL_QUARTER_DURATION`, `AFL_TOTAL_GAME_SECONDS`
  - `RATING_DECAY_DEFAULT_DAYS`, `SIM_NOISE_SD`, `SIM_WP_SCALING_FACTOR`

* Placeholder dashboard functions (`create_monitoring_dashboard_data()`, `get_model_health_status()`) now return informative empty structures instead of fake data.

## Bug Fixes

* `parquet_from_urls_parallel()` now warns instead of silently dropping data when column selection finds no matching columns.

* `parquet_from_urls_parallel()` now errors (instead of just warning) when downloads completely fail and no local data is available.

* `mark_download_skippable()` now logs write errors instead of silently swallowing them.

* `read_local_parquet()` now only deletes files on likely corruption errors, not transient failures (memory, locking).

* `load_torp_ratings()` and `load_team_ratings()` now warn when returning empty data.

* `load_from_url()` now warns when round filtering is requested but no round column exists in the data.

* Integration test data loading is now guarded against CRAN environments.

* Fixed double fixture load in `get_afl_week()` - now loads fixtures once and filters twice.

## Optimized Parameters

* Re-optimized rating constants with per-component decay: `RATING_DECAY_RECV` (260), `RATING_DECAY_DISP` (700), `RATING_DECAY_SPOIL` (295), `RATING_DECAY_HITOUT` (700). Prior games: `RATING_PRIOR_GAMES_RECV` (12.56), `RATING_PRIOR_GAMES_DISP` (5.83), `RATING_PRIOR_GAMES_SPOIL` (3.00), `RATING_PRIOR_GAMES_HITOUT` (15.00).

* Re-optimized credit assignment constants for disposal, reception, and position adjustment.

## Code Quality

* Merged `logging_monitoring.R` and `safe_logging.R` into a single `logging.R` file for better organization.

* Fixed global state issues by replacing `<<-` operator with package-level environment for logging state.

* Improved AUC calculation efficiency using Mann-Whitney U-statistic (O(n log n) instead of O(n^2)).

* Fixed inefficient `rbind()` patterns in `compare_baseline_models()` and `evaluate_baseline_models()` by using pre-allocated lists with `dplyr::bind_rows()`.

* Fixed `mutate_all()` performance issue in data validation using `lapply()` for column-wise operations.

* Removed unused `match_id` parameter from `match_xgs()` function.

* Replaced deprecated `dplyr::group_by_all()` with `dplyr::group_by(dplyr::across(dplyr::everything()))`.

## Documentation

* Added two vignettes: Getting Started and torp Reference Guide (consolidating ratings, models, data architecture, and simulation).

* Added pkgdown site configuration with comprehensive reference sections.

* Improved README with lifecycle badge, ecosystem table, and torpmodels install instructions.

## Internal Changes

* Reduced exported functions - internalized helper functions:
  - `rds_from_url()`, `file_reader()` (internal data loading helpers)
  - `predict_wp_naive()`, `predict_wp_time_only()` (baseline model internals)
  - `log_prediction_event()`, `log_data_quality()` (internal logging helpers)
  - `get_wp_model_info()`, `check_wp_model_health()` (model diagnostics)
  - `harmonic_mean()`, `norm_name()` (utility helpers)

* Moved manual test scripts to `tests/manual/` directory.

* Archived legacy data-raw scripts to `inst/extdata/archive/scripts/`.

* Enhanced test helper functions with additional mock data creators.

## Test Coverage

* Added tests for `helper_functions.R` internal functions.
* Added tests for `match_xg_functions.R` function signatures.
* Added tests for `sim-helpers.R` simulation functions.
