\title{Vectorized Harmonic Mean of Two Numeric Vectors}
\usage{
harmonic_mean(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector (e.g. home_shots).}

\item{y}{Numeric vector (e.g. away_shots).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of harmonic means. Returns NA for pairs where either value is 0.
}
\description{
Computes the row-wise harmonic mean of two numeric vectors. The harmonic mean
is particularly useful in AFL analytics for averaging rates and proportions,
giving less weight to extreme values than the arithmetic mean.
}
\examples{
# Calculate harmonic mean of shot attempts
home_shots <- c(10, 15, 20)
away_shots <- c(12, 18, 25)
harmonic_mean(home_shots, away_shots)

# Returns NA when one value is zero
harmonic_mean(c(10, 0, 20), c(15, 10, 25))
}
